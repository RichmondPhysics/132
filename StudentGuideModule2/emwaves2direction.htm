<TABLE>
  <TBODY>
  <TR>
    <TD vAlign=top>This java applet is a simulation that demonstrates 
      magnetostatics and electromagnetic waves in two dimensions. 
      <P>When the applet starts up you will see a white circle (called the 
      "source") emitting red and green circular waves. The color indicates the 
      electric field; green areas are positive (towards you) and the red areas 
      are negative (away from you). (In this applet, the electric field is 
      always perpendicular to the plane of the screen; that means there are no 
      free charges, and all currents have to be perpendicular to the screen as 
      well. It also means the electrostatic potential is zero everywhere.) 
      <P>In addition to the red and green color, you will see arrows which 
      indicate the direction of the magnetic field (which is always in the plane 
      of the screen). 
      <P>Also, sources and conductors may show a blue or yellow color, 
      indicating current. Yellow means that current is flowing towards you and 
      blue means it is flowing away from you. 
      <P>Conductors, dielectrics, and other media will show up as gray. There 
      aren't enough colors or shades of gray to make the different kinds of 
      media look different. Use the <B>Show Material Type</B> menu option to 
      tell them apart. 
      <P>These are electromagnetic waves, so in real life they would be moving 
      at the speed of light. 
      <P>This is the TM version of the applet. There is also a <A 
      href="http://www.falstad.com/emwave1/">TE version</A>. 
      <HR>

      <P>The <B>Setup popup</B> can be used to view some interesting pre-defined 
      experiments. Once an experiment is selected, you may modify it all you 
      want. The choices are: 
      <UL>
        <LI><B>Single Source</B>: this is a single wire with an alternating 
        current, creating circular waves. 
        <LI><B>Two Sources</B>: this is two wires emitting circular waves, 
        creating an interference pattern between them. 
        <LI><B>Plane Wave</B>: this demonstrates a simple plane wave source. 
        <LI><B>Intersecting Planes</B>: this demonstrates two plane waves 
        intersecting at right angles. 
        <P>The following 28 setups are all static, involving steady currents or 
        permanent magnets, with no waves (except at the start). When you select 
        one of them, just wait a bit for the system to reach a steady state. 
        <P></P>
        <LI><B>Single Wire</B>: this is a wire with a steady current. 
        <LI><B>Wire Pair</B>: this is two wires with current in the same 
        direction. 
        <LI><B>Dipole Wire Pair</B>: this is two wires with current in opposite 
        directions. 
        <LI><B>Magnet Pair</B>: this is two permanent magnets with the north 
        poles facing up. 
        <LI><B>Magnet Pair, Opp</B>: this is two permanent magnets; the left one 
        has the north pole facing up and the right one has it facing down. 
        <LI><B>Magnet Pair Stacked</B>: this is two permanent magnets stacked on 
        top of each other with the north poles facing up. 
        <LI><B>Magnet Pair Stacked Opp</B>: this is two permanent magnets 
        stacked on top of each other with the north poles facing towards each 
        other. 
        <LI><B>Uniform Field</B>: this is a (fairly) uniform field created by 
        currents on the left and right sides of the screen. 
        <LI><B>Field Near Aperture</B>: this shows a uniform magnetic field 
        leaking through an aperture in a perfect conductor. 
        <LI><B>Solenoid</B>: this shows the cross section of a coil of wire with 
        a current running through it. 
        <LI><B>Toroidal Solenoid</B>: this shows the cross section of a torus 
        (donut) with a coil of wire wrapped around it. 
        <LI><B>Sphere</B>: this shows the cross section of a uniformly 
        magnetized sphere (actually an infinitely long cylinder, since this is 
        2-D). 
        <LI><B>Thick Wire</B>: this shows a thick wire carrying a current. 
        <LI><B>Hole in Wire 1</B>: this shows a thick current-carrying wire with 
        a hole in it, resulting in no field in the hole. 
        <LI><B>Hole in Wire 2</B>: this shows a thick current-carrying wire with 
        an off-center hole in it, resulting in a uniform field in the hole. 
        <LI><B>Ferromagnet</B>: this is a <A 
        href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/solids/ferro.html" 
        target=_blank>ferromagnet</A> (like soft iron) near a solenoid. The 
        ferromagnets in this applet are linear and have no hysteresis. 
        <LI><B>Diamagnet</B>: this is a strong <A 
        href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/solids/magpr.html#c2" 
        target=_blank>diamagnet</A> near a solenoid. The diamagnets in this 
        applet are far stronger than any known diamagnet, to illustrate the 
        effect more clearly. 
        <LI><B><A 
        href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/solids/meis.html" 
        target=_blank>Meissner Effect</A></B>: this shows a superconductor near 
        a solenoid. The superconductor rejects all magnetic fields (except at 
        the surface). The blue and yellow color in the superconductor indicates 
        the presence of eddy currents. Since this is a superconductor, the eddy 
        currents do not die out. 
        <LI><B>Horseshoe Magnet</B>: this shows an electromagnet in the shape of 
        a horseshoe. 
        <LI><B>Horseshoe + Load</B>: this shows a horseshoe electromagnet 
        carrying a ferromagnetic load. 
        <LI><B>Magnetic Shielding 1</B>: this shows the magnetic field of 
        solenoid being shielded by a ferromagnet. Notice that there is very 
        little field below the ferromagnet. (You will see a somewhat strong 
        magnetic field one grid square below the ferromagnet, but that is a bug 
        and this would not happen in real life.) 
        <LI><B>Magnetic Shielding 2</B>: this shows the magnetic field of 
        solenoid being shielded by a ferromagnetic box. Notice that there is 
        very little field outside of the ferromagnet. The ferromagnet is 
        conducting and thus will reflect the wave generated when the current is 
        first switched on in the solenoid; so you will have to wait a bit for 
        the oscillation to die out. 
        <LI><B>Magnetic Shielding 3</B>: this shows the magnetic field of 
        solenoid being shielded by a ferromagnetic sphere. The field is weaker 
        outside of the ferromagnet; the brightness is turned up so that you can 
        see that the field outside looks like the field of a magnetic dipole 
        (compare it to <B>Dipole Wire Pair</B> and <B>Sphere</B>). You will have 
        to wait even longer for the oscillation to die out because the 
        brightness is turned up and the current is much stronger than in the 
        previous setup. 
        <LI><B>Magnetic Shielding 4</B>: this shows a ferromagnetic box 
        shielding its interior from a uniform external field. 
        <LI><B>Magnetic Circuit 1</B>: this shows a magnetic circuit; the field 
        generated by the solenoid on the right is being "conducted" by 
        ferromagnetic material. 
        <LI><B>Magnetic Circuit 2</B>: this shows a magnetic circuit with an air 
        gap on the left. 
        <LI><B>Monopole Attempt</B>: This is a simulation of what would happen 
        if you tried to make a magnetic monopole (a magnet with only a north 
        pole and no south pole) by taking a bunch of magnets and forcing them 
        into a square with their south poles in the center. Instead of getting a 
        monopole, you would find that the gaps between the magnets would act as 
        south poles, and the field there would be much stronger than on the 
        faces of the magnets. If you could force them together perfectly with no 
        gaps, there would be no field at all anywhere because all the currents 
        would cancel out. 
        <LI><B><A href="http://cbp-1.lbl.gov/cycle2p02d.htm" 
        target=_blank>Quadrupole Lens</A></B>: this shows four magnets in the 
        shape of hyperbolas, forced together. This device is used to focus 
        particle beams. 
        <LI><B><A href="http://www.matchrockets.com/ether/halbach.html" 
        target=_blank>Halbach Array</A></B>: this shows five magnets in a linear 
        Halbach array. The magnetic field is concentrated on the bottom side. To 
        see the orientations of the individual magnets, select <B>Show 
        Magnetization</B> from the <B>Show</B> popup. 
        <LI><B>Halbach Array (long)</A></B>: this shows a longer Halbach array. 
        <LI><B>Halbach Array (dipole)</A></B>: this shows a circular Halbach 
        array with a uniform magnetic field inside. 
        <LI><B>Halbach Array (quadrupole)</A></B>: this shows a circular Halbach 
        array with a magnetic quadrupole inside. 
        <P>The rest of the setups are all dynamic, involving changing currents 
        and waves. 
        <P></P>
        <LI><B>Dielectric</B>: this shows wave packets being reflected by a 
        dielectric medium. Waves travel slower in a dielectric, causing the 
        incoming wave to be partially reflected and partially refracted. 
        <LI><B>Fair Conductor Reflection</B>: this shows wave packets being 
        reflected by a fairly good conductor. When waves hit a conductor, it 
        causes eddy currents which cause the wave to be mostly reflected. A 
        small fraction of the wave is transmitted, and that part is attenuated 
        almost immediately. 
        <LI><B>Poor Conductor Reflection</B>: this shows wave packets being 
        reflected by a poor conductor. When waves hit the conductor, it causes 
        weak eddy currents which cause the wave to be partly reflected. Part of 
        the wave is transmitted, and that part is quickly attenuated by eddy 
        currents. 
        <LI><B>Skin Effect 1</B>: this shows that waves hitting a conductor will 
        only penetrate a certain distance, called the <A 
        href="http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/SkinDepth.html">skin 
        depth</A>. (Actually the strength of the wave falls off exponentially, 
        but the skin depth is a measure of how fast this happens.) 
        <LI><B>Skin Effect 2</B>: this shows that the skin depth is smaller for 
        higher-frequency waves. 
        <LI><B>Resonant Absorption</B>: this creates a medium made up of little 
        resonators. The resonators have a characteristic frequency which is the 
        same as the frequency of the incoming radiation. Since this medium has a 
        resonance frequency, it is dispersive, which means that waves of 
        different frequencies travel at different speeds. Here, since the 
        incoming radiation's frequency is close to the resonance frequency, it 
        is absorbed by the medium, although much of it is reflected because of 
        the discontinuity caused by the strong absorption. 
        <LI><B>Dispersion 1</B>: this setup illustrates dispersion in the 
        resonant medium. The incident wave has a frequency which is much lower 
        than the resonance frequency, so the refractive index is only slightly 
        higher than 1. So it is transmitted largely without reflection. 
        <LI><B>Dispersion 2</B>: Here the incident wave has a frequency which is 
        slightly lower than the resonance frequency, so waves travel much more 
        slowly in the medium, and more of the wave is reflected. Also there is 
        some absorption, so the farther the wave travels into the medium, the 
        weaker it is. 
        <LI><B>Dispersion 3</B>: Here the incident wave has a frequency which is 
        slightly higher than the resonance frequency, so waves have a phase 
        velocity that is faster than in a vacuum. So waves seem to move faster 
        than the speed of light in a vacuum. Still, the signal velocity in the 
        medium is not faster than the speed of light; when the source is first 
        switched on, the initial wave train travels at normal speed. 
        <LI><B>Dispersion 4</B>: Here the incident wave has a frequency which is 
        much higher than the resonance frequency, so waves have a phase velocity 
        that is only slightly faster than in a vacuum. So the medium has very 
        little affect on the incoming wave. 
        <LI><B>Magnetic Diffusion</B>: this shows a magnetic field (generated by 
        a wire) diffusing slowly through a conductor. Wait for the field to 
        slowly build up, then get rid of the wire (the yellow square) by 
        clicking on it. The field will slowly die out; the presence of the 
        conductor causes changes in magnetic field to diffuse slowly rather than 
        happening at the speed of light. 
        <LI><B>Oscillating Ring</B>: this shows the cross section of a ring with 
        an oscillating current running through it. This is approximated by two 
        wires with current running in opposite directions. The oscillating 
        current causes radiation; this is called magnetic dipole radiation. 
        <LI><B>Oscillating Ring Pair</B>: this shows the cross section of two 
        rings with an oscillating current running through them in opposite 
        directions, resulting in magnetic quadrupole radiation. 
        <LI><B>Ring Induction</B>: this shows a ring with an oscillating current 
        running through it, inducing an opposing current in another ring right 
        below it. 
        <LI><B>Wire Induction</B>: this shows a wire with an oscillating current 
        running through it, inducing an opposing current in another wire right 
        below it. 
        <LI><B>Ring + Fair Conductor</B>: this shows a ring with a slowly 
        oscillating current running through it, with a fairly good conductor 
        underneath it. The changing current generates eddy currents in the 
        conductor, causing the magnetic field to diffuse slowly through the 
        conductor to the other side. 
        <LI><B>Ring + Poor Conductor</B>: this shows a ring with a slowly 
        oscillating current running through it, with a poor conductor underneath 
        it. The eddy currents are much weaker, so the magnetic field diffuses 
        quickly through the conductor to the other side. 
        <LI><B>Wire + Fair Conductor</B>: this shows a wire with a slowly 
        oscillating current running through it, with a fairly good conductor 
        underneath it. The changing current generates eddy currents in the 
        conductor, causing the magnetic field to diffuse slowly through the 
        conductor to the other side. 
        <LI><B>Wire + Poor Conductor</B>: this shows a wire with a slowly 
        oscillating current running through it, with a poor conductor underneath 
        it. The eddy currents are much weaker, so the magnetic field diffuses 
        quickly through the conductor to the other side. 
        <LI><B>Rings + Ferromagnet</B>: this is an oscillating ring (in the 
        middle) positioned near two conducting rings. There is a ferromagnetic 
        core present which cause the induced current to be stronger in the lower 
        ring than in the upper ring. 
        <LI><B>Osc. Solenoid</B>: this is a solenoid with an oscillating current 
        running through it. 
        <LI><B>Transformer</B>: this is two coils wrapped around each other, 
        with an oscillating current in the inner one. This induces a current in 
        the outer one. This transformer is rather pointless since the number of 
        turns is the same in the inner and outer coils. This applet cannot 
        demonstrate transformers very well because there is no way to measure 
        voltage, and because the current is always perpendicular to the screen, 
        and none of the conducting grid squares are connected to one another. 
        Also the current in the inner coil is fixed and is not affected by the 
        outer coil. 
        <LI><B>Osc. Toroidal Solenoid</B>: this is a toroidal solenoid with an 
        oscillating current running through it. 
        <LI><B>Coaxial Cable</B>: this is a cross section of a coaxial cable, 
        with an oscillating current running through it. Note that there is very 
        little radiation (assuming the wavelength of the oscillation is small 
        compared to the diameter of the cable). This is part of the reason that 
        coaxial cable is used to carry high frequencies--it reduces the amount 
        of power loss from radiation. 
        <LI><B>Cond. in Osc. Field</B>: this is a small conducting square in a 
        uniform field that is oscillating. 
        <LI><B>Moving Wire</B>: this is a current-carrying wire which is moving 
        at a significant fraction of the speed of light. The magnetic field 
        lines are slightly flattened out. It stops periodically and then starts 
        again so you can see the radiation generated when its velocity changes. 
        <LI><B>Moving Wire in Tube</B>: this is a current-carrying wire which is 
        moving through a conducting tube. When the wire moves it causes a 
        changing magnetic field, which generates eddy currents in the tube. The 
        presence of the tube causes a force on the wire opposing the direction 
        of motion, which you can see by selecting <B>Show Force</B> from the 
        <B>Show</B> menu. 
        <LI><B>Moving Magnet in Tube</B>: this is a magnet which is <A 
        href="http://www.exploratorium.edu/snacks/eddy_currents.html" 
        target=_blank>moving through a conducting tube</A>. When the magnet 
        moves it causes a changing magnetic field, which generates eddy currents 
        in the tube. The presence of the tube causes a force on the magnet 
        opposing the direction of motion, which you can see by selecting <B>Show 
        Force</B> from the <B>Show</B> menu. The magnet stops periodically to 
        give the eddy currents a chance to die out. 
        <LI><B>Rotating Magnet 1</B>: this is a rotating magnet, which emits 
        radiation. Select <B>Show Magnetization</B> to see the direction the 
        magnet is pointing. 
        <LI><B>Rotating Magnet 2</B>: this is a magnet which rotates through 180 
        degrees and then reverses direction. This causes it to emit radiation. 
        <LI><B>Scattering 1</B>: this shows a plane wave being scattered by a 
        small resonator. The incoming plane wave gets turned off periodically so 
        you can see the scattered wave better. The frequency of the incoming 
        wave is close to the resonant frequency of the resonator, so the 
        scattered wave is relatively strong. 
        <LI><B>Scattering 2</B>: Here the frequency of the incoming wave is not 
        as close to the resonant frequency of the resonator, so the scattered 
        wave is much weaker. 
        <LI><B>Big TM11 Mode</B>: this creates a small superconducting cavity 
        with a standing wave inside it. The electric field is 90 degrees out of 
        phase with the magnetic field. The field in the cavity is oscillating in 
        its TM11 mode. 
        <LI><B>TM11 Modes</B>: this creates a set of small superconducting 
        cavities with TM11 standing waves inside them. 
        <LI><B>TMn1 Modes</B>: this creates a set of small superconducting 
        cavities with TM11, TM21, and TM31 standing waves inside them. (If the 
        resolution is set higher then more cavities are present with higher 
        modes.) 
        <LI><B>TMnn Modes</B>: this creates a set of small superconducting 
        cavities with various TM modes inside them. 
        <LI><B>TMn1 Mode Combos</B>: this creates a set of small superconducting 
        cavities, with various combinations of TMn1 modes inside them. 
        <LI><B>TMnn Mode Combos</B>: this creates a set of small superconducting 
        cavities, with various combinations of TM modes inside them. 
        <LI><B>Triangle Modes</B>: this creates a set of small triangular 
        cavities with standing waves. 
        <LI><B>Circular Modes 1</B>: this creates a set of small circular 
        cavities with standing waves. 
        <LI><B>Circular Modes 2</B>: this creates a circular cavity with two 
        standing waves superimposed 90 degrees out of phase so that the fields 
        appear to rotate. 
        <LI><B>Waveguides 1</B>: This creates a series of <A 
        href="http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Personal/D.Jefferies/wguide.html" 
        target=_blank>waveguides</A> of different widths. Narrower waveguides, 
        like at the left end of the screen, have higher cutoff frequencies. 
        <P>Notice that the waves seem to be moving faster in thinner waveguides. 
        They appear to be moving faster than waves normally move in the applet. 
        This is because the phase velocity is faster in thinner waveguides; but 
        the signal velocity is actually slower than normal, as you can verify by 
        clicking the <B>Clear Waves</B> button and watching the wave move down 
        the guide for the first time. 
        <P>Since the waveguides are being driven by a plane wave, only the TE01 
        mode is present. (See the <A 
        href="http://www.falstad.com/embox/guide.html" target=_blank>waveguide 
        applet</A> for another way to view waveguide modes.) 
        <P></P>
        <LI><B>Waveguides 2</B>: This is just the same set of waveguides with a 
        lower frequency. The waveguide on the left has a cutoff frequency that 
        is higher than the source, so there is no wave motion in it. You can fix 
        this by turning the <B>Source Frequency</B> slider up. 
        <LI><B>Waveguides 3</B>: This is a set of identical waveguides being 
        driven by small holes at different locations. This causes different sets 
        of modes to be excited in different proportions. When the guide is being 
        driven near the center, the TE01 mode is dominant, but when it is driven 
        near the edge, the TE02 mode is more prevalent. The frequency is low 
        enough so that all other modes are cut off. You can fix this by turning 
        the frequency up. By turning the frequency down, you can cut off the 
        TE02 mode as well. 
        <LI><B>Waveguides 4</B>: This is a set of identical waveguides with 
        various modes present. The first waveguide contains the TE01 mode; the 
        second contains the TE02 mode; the third contains the TE03 mode; the 
        fourth contains TE01 and TE02; the fifth contains TE01 and TE03; the 
        sixth contains TE02 and TE03. (There will not be room on your screen for 
        all these modes if your resolution is not set high enough.) 
        <P>Notice that the higher modes (TE02 and especially TE03) seem to be 
        moving faster. This is because the phase velocity of TE02 and TE03 is 
        greater than that of TE01. Their signal velocities are slower, though, 
        which is why it takes the TE03 wave so long to make it down to the end 
        of the waveguide. Also if you turn off the source (by setting the source 
        popup to "No Sources") it will take quite a while for the TE03 mode to 
        stop. </P>
        <LI><B>Resonant Cavities 1</B>: This creates a series of rectangular 
        cavities being driven by a plane wave from above. As you change the 
        frequency you will see the response of each cavity change. Each cavity 
        has a different resonant frequency so it will respond differently. After 
        changing the frequency you may want to wait a bit for things to settle 
        down (or turn the simulation speed way up). 
        <LI><B>Single Slit</B>: this demonstrates <A 
        href="http://homepages.tig.com.au/~flavios/diffrac.htm" 
        target=_blank>diffraction</A> of waves travelling through a slit. 
        <LI><B>Double Slit</B>: this demonstrates diffraction of waves 
        travelling through a double slit. 
        <LI><B>Triple Slit</B>. 
        <LI><B>Obstacle</B>: this demonstrates diffraction of waves travelling 
        around an obstacle. 
        <LI><B>Half Plane</B>: this demonstrates diffraction of waves around the 
        edge of a plane. 
        <LI><B>Lloyd's Mirror</B>: This shows an interferometer which consists 
        of a point source close to a mirror (at the bottom of the window). The 
        waves coming from the source interfere with the waves coming from its 
        mirror image. </LI></UL>
      <P>The <B>Source popup</B> controls the wave sources (oscillating 
      currents). It has the following settings: 
      <UL>
        <LI><B>No Sources</B>: there will be no sources of wave motion. 
        <LI><B>1 Src, 1 Freq</B>: there will be a single source of sinusoidal 
        waves at a single frequency (set using the <B>Source Frequency</B> 
        slider). This source can be dragged anywhere on the screen with the 
        mouse. 
        <LI><B>1 Src, 2 Freq</B>: the source will be emitting two waves, at 
        separate frequencies. The first frequency is set using the <B>Source 
        Frequency</B> slider, and the second frequency is set using <B>2nd 
        Frequency</B>. 
        <LI><B>2 Src, 1 Freq</B>: two sources will be created, both at the same 
        frequency. But you can select the phase difference using the <B>Phase 
        Difference</B> slider. If the slider is all the way to the left, the 
        sources will be in phase; if it is all the way to the right, the sources 
        will be 180 degrees out of phase. (The top one will be green while the 
        bottom one is red, and vice versa.) 
        <LI><B>2 Src, 2 Freq</B>: the two sources will be at different 
        frequencies. The <B>Source 2 Frequency</B> slider can be used to set the 
        second one's frequency. 
        <LI><B>3 Src, 1 Freq</B> or <B>4 Src, 1 Freq</B>: 3 or 4 sources will be 
        created, all at the same frequency. 
        <LI><B>1 Src, 1 Freq (Packet)</B>: the source will emit wave packets 
        periodically. 
        <LI><B>x Plane Src, y Freq</B>: the source(s) will emit <A 
        href="http://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/fs-1037/dir-027/_4031.htm" 
        target=_blank>plane waves</A> rather than circular waves. The location 
        and direction of the plane wave can be modified by dragging one or both 
        of the two white circles. If the white circles are located at the edge 
        of the screen, the plane is extended offscreen; otherwise it is not. 
        Since the waves are not extended infinitely offscreen they are not true 
        plane waves, strictly speaking. 
        <LI><B>1 Plane 1 Freq (Packet)</B>: the source will emit plane wave 
        packets. </LI></UL>
      <P>The <B>Mouse popup</B> controls what happens when the mouse is clicked. 
      The following settings are possible: 
      <UL>
        <LI><B>Mouse = Add Perf. Conductor</B>: Clicking on a point will create 
        a perfect conductor there. Clicking on an existing conductor will erase 
        it. 
        <LI><B>Mouse = Add Good Conductor</B>: Clicking on a point will create a 
        conductor which is not perfect but is still pretty good. 
        <LI><B>Mouse = Add Fair Conductor</B>: Clicking on a point will create a 
        fairly good conductor. 
        <LI><B>Mouse = Add Current (+)</B>: Clicking on a point will create a 
        wire with current flowing in the positive z direction (towards you). 
        <LI><B>Mouse = Add Current (-)</B>: Clicking on a point will create a 
        wire with current flowing in the negative z direction (away from you). 
        <LI><B>Mouse = Add Ferromagnet</B>: Clicking on a point will create a <A 
        href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/solids/ferro.html" 
        target=_blank>ferromagnetic</A> medium. The ferromagnets in this applet 
        are linear and have no hysteresis (except for the permanent magnets). 
        <LI><B>Mouse = Add Diamagnet</B>: Clicking on a point will create a <A 
        href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/solids/magpr.html#c2" 
        target=_blank>diamagnetic</A> medium. The diamagnets in this applet are 
        far stronger than any known diamagnet, to illustrate the effect more 
        clearly. 
        <LI><B>Mouse = Add Dielectric</B>: Clicking on a point will create a 
        dielectric medium. 
        <LI><B>Mouse = Add Magnet (Down/Up/Left/Right)</B>: Clicking on a point 
        will create a permanent magnet with the north pole pointing in the 
        direction indicated. 
        <LI><B>Mouse = Add Resonant Medium</B>: Clicking on a point will create 
        a resonant medium. 
        <LI><B>Mouse = Clear</B>: Clicking on a point will remove whatever is 
        there. 
        <LI><B>Mouse = Adjust Conductivity</B>: Clicking on a point and dragging 
        out a rectangular area will allow you to adjust the conductivity of the 
        conductors in that area using the <B>Conductivity</B> slider. The 
        <B>Show Material Type</B> menu option may come in handy here (and in the 
        following options) to see feedback from the changes you are making and 
        to compare the conductivity of all conductors on the screen. 
        <LI><B>Mouse = Adjust Permeability</B>: Clicking on a point and dragging 
        out a rectangular area will allow you to adjust the permeability of the 
        ferromagnets in that area using the <B>Permeability</B> slider. 
        <LI><B>Mouse = Adjust Current</B>: Clicking on a point and dragging out 
        a rectangular area will allow you to adjust the current flowing through 
        the wires in that area using the <B>Current</B> slider. 
        <LI><B>Mouse = Adjust Dielectric</B>: Clicking on a point and dragging 
        out a rectangular area will allow you to adjust the dielectric constant 
        on the dielectrics in that area using the <B>Dielectric Constant</B> 
        slider. 
        <LI><B>Mouse = Adjust Mag Dir</B>: Clicking on a point and dragging out 
        a rectangular area will allow you to adjust the direction of the 
        permanent magnets in that area using the <B>Direction</B> slider. 
        <LI><B>Mouse = Adjust Mag Strength</B>: Clicking on a point and dragging 
        out a rectangular area will allow you to adjust the strength of the 
        permanent magnets in that area using the <B>Strength</B> slider. 
</LI></UL>
      <P>The <B>Show</B> popup determines which fields or other quantities to 
      display, and how to display them. 
      <UL>
        <LI><B>Show Electric Field (E)</B>: Show the electric field as green 
        (positive, toward you) or red (negative, away from you). 
        <LI><B>Show Magnetic Field (B)</B>: Show the magnetic field as arrows. 
        The arrows go from dark green to light green and then to white as the 
        field gets stronger. 
        <LI><B>Show B Lines</B>: Show the magnetic field as lines. The color of 
        the lines go from dark green to light green and then to white as the 
        field gets stronger. The density of the lines is kept fairly constant, 
        so in order to determine the field strength you need to look at the 
        color of the lines rather than how far apart they are. 
        <LI><B>Show B Strength</B>: Show the magnetic field strength using 
        shades of green. 
        <LI><B>Show Current (j)</B>: Show the current density as yellow 
        (positive, toward you) or blue (negative, away from you). 
        <LI><B>Show E/B</B>: Show both the electric field and the magnetic field 
        arrows. 
        <LI><B>Show E/B lines</B>: Show both electric field and the magnetic 
        field lines. 
        <LI><B>Show E/B/j</B>: Show both the electric field and the magnetic 
        field arrows; in conductors, or where the current is nonzero, show the 
        current density instead of the electric field. 
        <LI><B>Show E/B lines/j</B>: Show both the electric field and the 
        magnetic field lines; in conductors, or where the current is nonzero, 
        show the current density instead of the electric field. 
        <LI><B>Show Mag. Intensity (H)</B>: Show the <A 
        href="http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/H.html" 
        target=_blank>magnetic intensity vector</A>, which is equal to the 
        magnetic field minus the magnetization. In linear media (which, in this 
        applet, is everywhere except for inside permanent magnets) this is equal 
        to <B>B</B> divided by the permeability. This will be the same as 
        <B>B</B> unless ferromagnets, diamagnets, or permanent magnets are 
        present. 
        <LI><B>Show Magnetization (M)</B>: Show the <A 
        href="http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/Magnetization.html" 
        target=_blank>magnetization</A> vector, which indicates the direction 
        and degree of alignment of magnetic media with an external field. In 
        permanent magnets, the magnetization is constant, and points to the 
        magnet's north pole. In ferromagnets, the magnetization is proportional 
        to the external field and in the same direction; in diamagnets, it is 
        proportional but in the opposite direction. Everywhere else it is zero. 
        <LI><B>Show Material Type</B>: Since all materials show up as gray, you 
        need this option to tell them apart:

          <LI>Diamagnets: red (<IMG 
          src="Electrodynamics Applet (TM) Directions_files/col_red.gif">) 
          <LI>Ferromagnets: green (<IMG

          yellow (<IMG 
          src="Electrodynamics Applet (TM) Directions_files/col_yellow.gif">) 
          </LI></UL>
        <LI><B>Show Vec. Potential</B>: Show the <A 
        href="http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/MagneticVectorPotential.html" 
        target=_blank>vector potential</A> (<B>A</B>) as green (positive, toward 
        you) or red (negative, away from you). The vector potential is always 
        perpendicular to the screen. 
        <LI><B>Show Poynting Vector</B>: Show the <A 
        href="http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/PoyntingVector.html" 
        target=_blank>Poynting vector</A>, which indicates the direction of 
        energy transfer. For waves, it is in the direction of wave motion. 
        <LI><B>Show Energy Density</B>: Show the <A 
        href="http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/EnergyDensity.html" 
        target=_blank>energy density</A> as shades of yellow. 
        <LI><B>Show Poynting/Energy</B>: Show both the energy density and the 
        Poynting vector. 
        <LI><B>Show Force</B>: Show magnetic force. The total force on each 
        object is added up by summing over each grid square (ignoring 
        speed-of-light delay) and the total is shown on every grid square taken 
        up by the object. 
        <LI><B>Show Effective Current</B>: Show the effective current density in 
        magnetic media caused by the alignment of magnetic dipoles. This is 
        equal to the curl of the magnetization. So for example, for permanent 
        magnets, this will show you the current distribution which will generate 
        the same field as the permanent magnet; a square permanent magnet acts 
        the same as a solenoid. 
        <LI><B>Show Magnetic Charge</B>: Show the effective magnetic charge 
        density for any permanent magnets. For setups involving just permanent 
        magnets, we can think of the magnetic field as originating from magnetic 
        charges at the north and south poles of the magnets. Using those 
        magnetic charges, we can calculate a scalar potential for every point on 
        the screen (just like the electrostatic potential) and calculate the 
        magnetic intensity vector (<B>H</B>) from that potential. So if you look 
        the magnetic charge of a permanent magnet you see that the two poles are 
        oppositely charged; if you look at the <B>H</B> it looks like the 
        electric field of two parallel plates with opposite charges on each 
        plate (with the plates located at the poles). 
        <LI><B>Show Curl E</B>: Show the curl of the electric field, which is 
        equal to the change in magnetic field (in the absence of currents), by 
        one of Maxwell's equations. 
        <LI><B>Show Bx</B>: Show the x component of the magnetic field; green 
        indicates positive (to the right) and red indicates negative (to the 
        left). 
        <LI><B>Show By</B>: Show the y component of the magnetic field; green 
        indicates positive (up) and red indicates negative (down). 
        <LI><B>Show Hx,Hy</B>: Show the x or y component of the magnetic 
        intensity vector. </LI></UL>
      <P>The <B>Clear Fields</B> button magically clears out any fields but does 
      not remove any currents, sources, or materials. The <B>Clear All</B> 
      button clears out everything. 
      <P>The <B>Stopped</B> checkbox stops the applet, in case you want to take 
      a closer look at something, or if you want to work on something with the 
      mouse without worrying about it changing out from under you. 
      <P>The <B>Simulation Speed</B> slider controls how far the waves move 
      between frames. If you slide this to the left, the applet will go faster 
      but the motion will be choppier. 
      <P>The <B>Resolution</B> slider allows you to speed up or slow down the 
      applet by adjusting the resolution; a higher resolution is slower but 
      looks better. 
      <P>The <B>Brightness</B> slider controls the brightness, just like on a TV 
      set. This can be used to view faint waves more easily.
