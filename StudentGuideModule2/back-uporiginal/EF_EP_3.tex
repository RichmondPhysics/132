\textbf{Objective}

\begin{itemize}
\item To investigate the relationship between the electric potential and
the electric field.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Apparatus}

\begin{itemize}
\item Electric field and potential simulation entitled {\it EM Field 6}.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Introduction}

In the previous units (which we will refer to as Investigation 1 and 2) we studied the dependence
of the electric field and the electric potential on $r$, the distance from
a charge distribution.
Now we will study the same ideas for a charge distribution commonly found in physics and chemistry
using the same methods we used before.

\textbf{Investigation 3: An Electric Dipole}

\textbf{Activity 1: The Electric Field}

(a) Start the program {\it EM Field 6} from the 132 menu or use the options under the 
\textbf{Display} menu to clear the table top and delete any charges.
Go to the \textbf{Sources} menu and select \textbf{3D Point Charges}.
A blank `table top' with a set of menu 
buttons at the top and bottom will appear.

(b) Go to the Display menu and set {\it EM Field 6} to
{\bf Show Grid} and {\bf Constrain to Grid} if they are not already set.
These choices will make the following investigation a bit easier to perform.

(c) Clear the table top and build an electric dipole by placing two magnitude
{}``4'' charges of opposite sign a distance 2 cm apart near the
left side of the table top.


(d) {\bf Prediction} How will the electric field be oriented inside the four charges?
How the field be oriented outside the four charges?
How will the field depend on $r$, the distance from the center of the four charges
at large $r$?

(e) Click on the \textbf{Field} option under the \textbf{Fields and Potentials} menu.
Click along a line perpendicular to the midpoint of a line joining the two charges.
The size and direction of the arrow represent the magnitude and direction of
the electric field at that point due to the dipole.
In what direction does the arrow point?
\vspace{15mm}

(f) Click on many points along the same line so that you get a wide range of magnitudes from large
(barely fits on the table top) to small (barely bigger than a dot).

(g) Print the table top and use a ruler to measure the lengths of each of the arrows
on your plot and the distance from the midpoint of a line joining the two charges. 
Enter this data in the table below.
Use the scale at the bottom of the table top to convert the length of each arrow into 
an electric field magnitude.
The units of the scale electric field vector are $1.0 ~ N/C$.

(h) \textbf{Prediction}: From Coulomb's Law, we expect the spatial variation
of the field strength to obey a power law: \( \left| E\right| =Ar^{r} \),
where \( A \) and \( n \) are constants. What do you predict the
value of \( n \) to be?\vspace{15mm}

(i) Graph your results. Using the power fitting
function, determine the power of the function, $n$ and record it here.
Attach the plot to this unit.
\vspace{15mm}

(j) Does your result agree with your prediction? Explain any discrepancy.\vspace{15mm}

(k) How do your results compare with the power law constants you found
in Investigations 1 and 2? Explain.\vspace{15mm}


\textbf{Activity 2: The Electric Potential}

(a) Under the {\bf Display} menu click on {\bf Clean up Screen} to erase the
electric field vectors.

(b) \textbf{Prediction}: You will now take measurements of the potential.
How do you expect the electric potential to change with distance from the electric dipole
along the line perpendicular to the midpoint of a line joining the two charges?
\vspace{15mm}
 
(c) Click on the \textbf{Potential} option under the \textbf{Field and Potential}
menu. Click on the table top and a marker will be
placed at that point and labeled with the value of the potential there.
Click on many spots on the table top along the line perpendicular to the midpoint of the
line joining the two charges.
When you are finished print the table top.
\vspace{15mm}

(d) Measure and record in the table the values of the distance from the
point charge and the potential.

(e) \textbf{Prediction}: From Coulomb's Law and the definition of the
electric potential, we expect the spatial variation of the potential
to obey a power law: \( \Delta V=Br^{m} \), where \( \mathbf{B} \)
and \( m \) are constants. What do you predict the value of \textbf{\( m \)}
to be?\vspace{15mm}


(f) Graph your results. Using the power fitting
function, determine the power of the function, $m$ and record it here.
\vspace{15mm}

(g) Does your result agree with your prediction? Explain any discrepancy.\vspace{15mm}

(h) How do your results compare with the power law constants you found
in Investigations 1 and 2? Explain.\vspace{15mm}


\textbf{Activity 3: Equipotential Lines and Field Lines}


(a) Under the \textbf{Field and Potential} menu, drag down to \textbf{Equipotentials}.
Click the mouse on the table top and a
dotted line will be drawn representing the equipotential line with a label
representing the value of the electric potential. {[}If
the curve does not close (i.e., the last point drawn doesn't match
up with the starting point), consult the instructor.{]} Map out the
equipotential lines by moving the cursor across the table top away
from each charge and clicking the mouse at regular intervals.

(b) What do these curves represent?\vspace{15mm}

(c) Where is the potential attractive and where is it repulsive for a
positive charge?\vspace{15mm}

(d) Under the \textbf{Field and Potential} menu, click on \textbf{Field Lines--Auto}.
The field lines of the charge distribution will be drawn. {[}If \textit{EM Field 6}
takes a long time to draw one of the field lines, consult your instructor.{]}
Print the result and attach it to this unit.
\vspace{30mm}
 
(e) How are the field lines and the equipotential lines related to one
another at the point where they cross?\vspace{15mm}
