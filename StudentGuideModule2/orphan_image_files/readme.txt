In 5/2015 I went through and cleaned the main directory, which probably had about 400 files in it, many with not-so-helpful names like "graph.fig". For the most part I was able to associate all of the support files with each lab, grouping them together in subdirectories.  This directory contains the few figures (.eps and other junk) that I wasn't able to associate with any lab.  So all of this stuff is probably useless old junk, but we'll keep it here anyway at least for a while.  --Matt Trawick
