\textbf{Objective} 

To explore uniform circular motion and the accelerations and
forces needed to maintain it.

\textbf{Overview} 

In this unit you will explore uniform circular motion, in which an object moves at a constant
speed in a circle. In particular, you will develop a mathematical description
of centripetal acceleration and the force needed to keep an object moving in
a circle.

\textbf{Moving in a Circle at a Constant Speed }

When a race car speeds around a circular track, or when David twirled a stone
at the end of a rope to clobber Goliath, or when a planet like Venus orbits
the sun, they undergo uniform circular motion. Understanding the forces which
govern orbital motion has been vital to astronomers in their quest to understand
the laws of gravitation. 

But we are getting ahead of ourselves, for as we have done in the case of linear
and projectile motion we will begin our study by considering situations involving
external applied forces that lead to circular motion in the absence of friction.

\vspace{0.3cm}

Let's begin our study with some very simple considerations. Suppose an astronaut
goes into outer space, ties a ball to the end of a rope, and spins the ball
so that it moves at a constant speed.

\textbf{Activity \stepcounter{activity}\arabic{activity}: Uniform Circular Motion }

\begin{enumerate}

\item Consider the figure above. What is the speed of a ball that moves in a circle
of radius $r = 2.5$ m if it takes 0.50 s to complete one revolution?
\vspace{18mm}

\item The speed of the ball is constant! Would you say that this is accelerated
motion?
\vspace{18mm}

\item What is the definition of acceleration? (Remember that acceleration is a
vector!)
\vspace{18mm}

\item Are velocity and speed the same thing? Is the velocity of the ball constant?
(Hint: Velocity is a vector quantity!)
\vspace{18mm}

\item In light of your answers to (c) and (d), would you like to change your answer
to part (b)? Explain.
\vspace{18mm}

\item As the ball moves on around the circle, what is the direction of its acceleration?
\vspace{18mm}

\item Use Newton's second law in vector form (\( \sum {\bf F} = m{\bf a}\)
) to describe the direction of the net force on the ball as it moves around
the circle.
\vspace{18mm}

\item If the ball is being twirled around on a string, what is the source of the
net force needed to keep it moving in a circle?
\vspace{18mm}

\end{enumerate}

\newpage 

\textbf{Activity \stepcounter{activity}\arabic{activity}: How Does a\( _{c} \) Depend on v and r?} 

\begin{enumerate}

\item Do you expect you would need more centripetal acceleration or less centripetal
acceleration to cause an object moving at a certain speed to rotate in a smaller
circle? In other words, would the magnitude, a\( _{c} \), have to increase
or decrease as $r$ decreases if circular motion is to be maintained? Explain.
\vspace{20mm}

\item Do you expect you would need more centripetal acceleration or less centripetal
acceleration to cause an object to rotate at a given radius $r$ if the speed $v$
is increased? In other words, would the magnitude, \( a_{c} \), have to increase
or decrease as $v$ increases if circular motion is to be maintained? Explain.
\vspace{20mm}

\end{enumerate}

You may have guessed that it requires more acceleration to move an object
of a certain speed in a circle of smaller radius and that it also takes more
acceleration to move an object that has a higher speed in a circle of a given
radius. From our past study of kinematics you might remember that the magnitude
of the centripetal acceleration is
\begin{equation}
a_{c}=\frac{v^{2}}{r}
\end{equation}
where $r$ is the radius of the circular motion and $v$ is the constant speed of the object.
The direction of the acceleration is always towards the center of the circle and it's magnitude is
constant (the speed doesn't change).


\textbf{Experimental Test of the Centripetal Force Equation }

Whenever you see an object of mass $m$ moving in a circle of
radius $r$ at a constant speed $v$, it must at all times be experiencing a net centripetal
force directed toward the center of the circle that has a magnitude of
\begin{equation}
F_{c}=ma_{c}=m\frac{v^{2}}{r}\label{eq:Fcent}
\end{equation}

Let's check this out. Does this rather odd equation really work for an external
force?

To test the validity of the derivation we must compare it to experience. We
will use a ``toy'' airplane suspended from a string and flying
in a circular path. See Figure \ref{fig:airplane}. 
We will use the video analysis system to measure the properties
of the motion and determine the horizontal and vertical components of the force
exerted on the airplane using Equation \ref{eq:Fcent}. We will compare that result with a
direct measurement of the tension in the string using a force sensor.

\end{figure}

\textbf{Activity \stepcounter{activity}\arabic{activity}: Verifying the F\( _{c} \) Equation }

\begin{enumerate}

\item To test the validity of Equation \ref{eq:Fcent} you will analyze data that has already been collected
(because of time constraints).
Download the movie {\it airplaneMovie.wmv} from the location\raggedright

{\verb!https://facultystaff.richmond.edu/~ggilfoyl/genphys/131/links.html!}

\noindent and store it on your computer {\tt Desktop}.
Download the {\it DataStudio} file {\it airplaneData.ds} from the same site and also store it on your {\tt Desktop}.

\item Some of the parameters of the airplane's ``flight'' are
\[
m_{plane} = 0.172~kg \qquad l_{plane} = 0.169~m \qquad L = 0.984~m
\]
where $m_{plane}$ is the mass of the plane, $l_{plane}$ is the length of the plane, and $L$
is the distance from the center of mass of the airplane, along the string, up to the pivot where
the string becomes vertical. See Figure \ref{fig:airplane}.

\item Determine the force exerted by the string as shown in Figure \ref{fig:airplane}.
Open {\it DataStudio} (Go to {\tt Start $\rightarrow$ All Programs $\rightarrow$ Physics  Application $\rightarrow$ DataStudio} 
and click `Open Activity' on the pop-up window when {\it DataStudio} starts.
Open the file you just downloaded.
You will see a measurement of the force exerted by the string on the airplane as a function of time.
The measurement was made using a force sensor.
See Figure \ref{fig:airplane}.
A string was attached from the hook on the sensor (red line in Figure \ref{fig:airplane}), ran vertically downward, passed through 
a small hole in a fixed steel rod (the pivot), and then was attached to the airplane.
This setup allowed the string to rotate freely so the only forces acting on the airplane were
gravity and the tension in the string (the friction force here is very small).
There are two distinct regions on your plot; where the airplane was orbiting ($0 < t < 40~s$)and then after it was caught
and placed on the lab table so the tension in the string went to zero ($45~s < t < 65~s$).
Use the {\it DataStudio} tools to measure the average force exerted by the string while it was orbiting.
Record your answer here along with the standard deviation.\label{getFscale}\\
\vspace{2mm}

\hspace{0.5in} $F_{scale} = \qquad\qquad \pm$

\vspace{5mm}

\item Determine the position of the airplane during at least two complete revolutions. To
do this task follow the instructions in the Appendix
for analyzing a movie file.
Calibrate your plot with the known length of the airplane $l_{plane}$.
When finished, you may want to export your measurements to a file for safekeeping.

\item Make a plot of all the points on the trajectory of the airplane during those two  revolutions  
by turning on all the measured points by clicking on {\bf Set trail length} (see {\bf Appendix D}).
Print your plot and attach it to your lab.

\item Is the motion circular? What is your evidence?
\vspace{10mm}

\item Use a ruler and your plot to measure the diameter of the airplane's trajectory.
Make at least five separate measurements between different diameters of the trajectory
and enter them in the table below.
Use the known length of the airplane $l_{plane}$ to convert those measurements to the scale of
the movie and then calculate each radius.

\begin{table}[h!]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline
Measured  &  Converted  &            \\
Diameter  &  Diameter   & Radius (m) \\ \hline
          &             &            \\
          &             &            \\
          &             &            \\
          &             &            \\
          &             &            \\
          &             &            \\
          &             &            \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}

\item What is the average radius of the motion? \\
\vspace{2mm}

\hspace{0.5in} $r_{ave} =$

\vspace{5mm}

\item To test the validity of the expression for \( F_{c} \) we must know the
speed. Use the measurements of the radius of the airplane's trajectory and the
time for at least two complete revolutions to calculate the average speed.
The time is recorded in the data table in the video analysis software.
\vspace{5mm}

\hspace{0.5in} \( v_{ave} \) = 
\vspace{5mm}

\item Use your results for the mass, the average velocity of the airplane, and
the average radius of the circular motion to calculate the centripetal force exerted by
the string.\label{getFc}
\vspace{5mm}

\hspace{0.5in} \( F_{c} \) = 
\vspace{5mm}

\item We will now determine the net force exerted by the string on the airplane
by using a little trigonometry.
Recall that we know $r_{ave}$, the radius of the airplane's circular path, and 
$L$, the total length of the string that is actually rotating. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Using these two distances ($r_{ave}$ and $L$), 
calculate the angle the string makes with
the horizontal. You may want to draw a diagram to do this. \\
\vspace{5mm}

\( \theta  =\)  \vspace{5mm}

\item We determined the horizontal component of the force on the airplane 
\( F_{c} \) in part \ref{getFc}. Knowing the angle \( \theta \) we can determine an
expression for the
net force exerted by the string on the airplane, \( F_{plane} \). Draw a vector
force diagram including \( F_{c} \) and \( F_{plane} \), derive an expression
for \( F_{plane} \) and calculate it. \\
\vspace{5mm}

\( F_{plane} =\)  \vspace{30mm}

\end{enumerate}

\item Compare your result for \( F_{plane} \) with the measurement of the spring
scale \( F_{scale} \) from part \ref{getFscale}. Should they be different? Should they be the same? Explain.
\vspace{30mm}


\item Calculate the difference between \( F_{plane} \) and \( F_{scale} \) (\( F_{plane} - F_{scale} \))and record it below.
Go around to the other lab groups and get their results for this quantity.
Make a histogram of the results you collect and calculate the average and standard deviation.
Print the histogram and attach it to this unit.
For information on making histograms, see \textbf{Appendix C}. For information on calculating the average and
standard deviation, see \textbf{Appendix A}. Record the average and standard deviation here.
\vspace{30mm}


\item What is your expectation for the difference \( F_{plane} - F_{scale} \)?
Do the data from the class support this expectation? 
Use the average and standard deviation for the class to quantitatively answer this question.
\vspace{15mm}

\item What does the histogram of the class data tell you? Be quantitative in your answer.
\vspace{15mm}

\item Discuss the major sources of uncertainty in this experiment.
