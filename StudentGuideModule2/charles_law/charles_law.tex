\textbf{Introduction}

The behavior of a gas can be described in terms of the macroscopic quantities:
temperature (T), pressure (P), and volume (V). The relationship between these
quantities is given by the equation of state of the gas. A real gas behaves
approximately as an ideal gas if it is far from liquefaction. In that case,
the equation of state of an ideal gas can be used to describe a real gas. For
a given mass of a gas, if one of the quantities P, T, or V is changed, a change
in the other two quantities probably will result. However, if one of the quantities
is kept constant, the relationship between the other two can be studied. The
relationship between temperature and volume of an ideal gas is called Charles' law.

The experimental apparatus is shown in the figure above and consists
of an air chamber containing dry air. The pressure on the air in the chamber is due to atmospheric
pressure applied through the movable piston.

\textbf{Activity 1: V-T Relationship for a Gas} \nopagebreak

(a) Check that there are no leaks in the apparatus by trying to compressing
the piston from the 100 mm position to the 10 mm position. It should become
increasingly difficult to push the plunger as the volume decreases. If this
is not the case, check the couplings for fit. If no problem is obvious, then
consult your instructor. 

(b) Open the {\it Charles' Law ss} activity in the 132 Workshop Folder under the
{\bf Start} menu.
Click on the window labeled \textit{Charles' Law Table}. 
This is where your data will be displayed as you record
it. This table display will show the values of the gas temperature in the air chamber
and the entry number.
The data-taking procedure you will follow is described here first.
One member of your team will heat the air chamber in the flask on the hot plate 
and call out the position of the piston.
Another member will record the position settings by hand in the table below
and
click the {\bf Keep} button on the {\it DataStudio} interface to record the 
temperature for that entry.
To begin recording data, make sure the piston is at the low end of the scale, and click
the {\bf Start} button on the {\it DataStudio} interface. 
The {\bf Start} button will change to a {\bf Keep} button and the table
display will show the value of the temperature next to the first entry in the table. 
The reading in the temperature column should be colored red.
Click the {\bf Keep} button to record this temperature (notice the reading in the Temperature
column beside the entry number changes from red to black). The next entry number
 will appear in the Entry column of the data table display.

%NOTE: For the first temperature reading, the air in the chamber will be
%in thermal equilibrium with the environment. This will not be the case immediately
%after adding ice for the next reading. Therefore, you must allow
%3-5 seconds for the system to return to thermal equilibrium after you add ice
% and before clicking on {\bf Keep} to record temperature values. 

(c) Now, immerse the air chamber in a beaker of cold, tap water water and click
{\bf Start} on the {\it DataStudio} interface. You can monitor the temperature
on the temperature versus time plot to the right.
Make sure the set screw on the side of the piston is released.

(d) When the temperature is stable click {\bf Keep} and that point will be recorded in the
table. One team member should read off the piston position while the other 
writes it in the table at the same time.

(e) Now turn up the heat. The piston will move as the gas expands.
Read out the position of the piston every one or two millimeters. The other team member
will click {\bf Keep} (recording the temperature) and record the piston position
in the table.

(f) Repeat step (e) until the piston no longer moves or the water starts to boil.
 
(g) Calculate the volume of the apparatus for each piston position and plot
this volume versus temperature. The diameter of the Gas-Law apparatus is written on its
base.

\textbf{Activity 2: Absolute Zero and the Kelvin Scale}

(a) The absolute zero of temperature can be defined as the temperature
at which the volume of an ideal gas is zero. Determine absolute
zero from the equation of your graph by setting V = 0 and solving for T.

(b) Determine the percent difference between your value of absolute
zero and the accepted value of -273\( ^{\circ } \)C. Are you happy or sad?

(c) Record the results from the other groups in class.
Obtain an average and standard deviation and record it here.
Are your results consistent with the class average? Explain.
