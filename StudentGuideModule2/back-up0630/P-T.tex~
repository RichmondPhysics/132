\textbf{Introduction}

The behavior of a gas can be described in terms of the macroscopic quantities:
temperature (T), pressure (P), and volume (V). The relationship between these
quantities is given by the equation of state of the gas. A real gas behaves
approximately as an ideal gas if it is far from liquefaction. In that case,
the equation of state of an ideal gas can be used to describe a real gas. For
a given mass of a gas, if one of the quantities P, T, or V is changed, a change
in the other two quantities probably will result. However, if one of the quantities
is kept constant, the relationship between the other two can be studied. The
relationship between temperature and pressure of an ideal gas has no particular name
associated with it.

The experimental apparatus is shown in the figure above and consists
of an air chamber containing dry air. The volume of the gas is fixed.

\textbf{Activity 1: P-T Relationship for a Gas}

(a) Open the {\it P-T} activity in the 132 Workshop Folder under the
{\bf Start} menu.
Click on the window labeled \textit{Temperature and Pressure Table}. 
This is where your data will be displayed as you record
it. This table display will show the values of the gas pressure in the air chamber and
the temperature of the heat bath.
The data-taking procedure you will follow is described here first.
You will slowly heat the air chamber on the hot plate
and every so often click the {\bf Keep} button on the {\it DataStudio} interface to record the 
temperature and pressure at that moment.
To begin recording data click
the {\bf Start} button on the {\it DataStudio} interface. 
The {\bf Start} button will change to a {\bf Keep} button and the table
display will show the value of the temperature and pressure in the table. 
Click the {\bf Keep} button to record this pressure and temperature. 

(b) Now, immerse the air chamber in a beaker of cold, tap water water and place it on
the hot plate. Click
{\bf Start} on the {\it DataStudio} interface. You can monitor the temperature
on the temperature versus time plot to the right or by watching the temperature in the
\textit{Temperature and Pressure Table}.
Turn the hot plate on. Record the temperature and pressure at approximately 5-7$^\circ$
intervals until the water is close to boiling.

(c) How are the pressure and temperature related?
Plot and fit your data with the appropriate function and record the results here.
Print your plot and attach it to this unit.

(d) When the beaker has cooled to a point where you can touch it, empty the warm water
in the sink, fill the beaker again with cold, tap water and repeat steps a-c.
Record the fit to your data here.

\textbf{Activity 2: Absolute Zero and the Kelvin Scale}

(a) The absolute zero of temperature can be defined as the temperature
at which the pressure of an ideal gas is zero. Determine absolute
zero from the equations you obtained by fitting your P-T data.

(b) Determine the percent difference between your value of absolute
zero and the accepted value of -273\( ^{\circ } \)C. Are you happy or sad?

(c) Record the results from the other groups in class.
Obtain an average and standard deviation and record it here.
Are your results consistent with the class average? Explain.
