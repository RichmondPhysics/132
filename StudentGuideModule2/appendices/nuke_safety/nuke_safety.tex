All of the radioactive sources we will use in class are very low-level
isotopes referred to as ``license-free'' sources.
The following guidelines should be followed for handling radioactive
materials in the classroom.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Eating, drinking, and application of cosmetics in the 
laboratory are not permitted.

\item Pipetting by mouth is never permitted. Use suction devices
such as pipette filters.

\item Gloves and lab coats should be worn when working with all liquid
isotopes.

\item Before leaving the lab, wash your hands thoroughly and check for
possible contamination with a survey instrument.

\item All radioactive liquid wastes are to be poured into the liquid
waste container, NEVER into a sink.

\item Report all spills, wounds, or other emergencies to your instructor.

\item Maintain good housekeeping at all times in the lab.

\item Store radioactive material only in the designated storage area. Do not
remove sources from the lab.

\end{enumerate}
