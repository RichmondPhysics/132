This lab steps studets through a derivation of electromagnetic waves, starting from how Maxwell fixed up Ampere's law, and culminating in his discovery that the speed of electromagnetic waves is the same as light.

\begin{itemize}[nosep]
\item Activity 1 points out that Ampere's law is missing something, which is qualitatively the displacement current.
\item Activity 2 steps them through the math leading to the constant $\mu_0 \epsilon_0$.
\item Activity 3 derives coupled differential equations, and then separates them into the wave equations for E and B.
\item Activity 4 has them calculate the speed of an electromagnetic wave from $\mu_0$ and $\epsilon_0$, and has them discover that it's the speed of light.  Wahoo!!!
\end{itemize}

Activities 3 has lots of math.  The first part is generally applicable to other physics 132 stuff (integrating $\vv{B} \cdot \vv{ds}$ around a path).  But the second part is advanced enough that it's basically copying a pattern, probably with not much understanding for many students.

Activity 4 works much better if students have seen the 1D wave equation before.  (Serway included it; Knight does not.)  It will still work if they haven't ever seen it before; they'll just have to take your word for what it means.  Students have difficulty recognizing that the form of the equations means that $v^2$ has to be the same as $1/(\mu_0 \epsilon_0)$.  I (Matt) have made a point to assign a homework problem previously where they have to do exactly this, for some other kind of wave.

BTW, it is worth emphasizing to students what a badass Maxwell must have been to figure all of this out.

\textbf{Objective} 

In this lab, you will work through the logic that James Clerk Maxwell used to derive the properties of electromagnetic waves.  You'll start with a brief review of the laws of electricity and magnetism that you already know, and then you'll extend them slightly to discover something totally new and amazing!

\medskip
\textbf{Activity 1: What's Wrong with Amp\`ere's Law?}

(a) You have already learned that Amp\'ere's law, $\displaystyle \oint \vv B \cdot \vv{ds} = \mu_0I_{enc}$, can be used to help you calculate the magnetic field near wires carrying electric current.  In the figure below, what is the direction of the magnetic field at the point shown, just above the current carrying wire?

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{deriving_em_waves/wire_and_loop.pdf}
\end{center}

In the 1850s, Amp\'ere's law was well understood.  But a very clever Scotsman named James Clerk Maxwell realized there might be something wrong with it.  He thought of the example shown below, in which current through a wire is charging up a capacitor.
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{deriving_em_waves/capacitor_and_loop.pdf}
\end{center}

(b) Suppose you draw the circular path for Amp\`ere's law (the ``Amp\`erian loop'') around the gap between the two capacitor plates as shown above.  Is there any actual current flowing between the two plates that is ``enclosed'' by that loop?   
\vspace{0.5in}

(c) According to a straightforward interpretation of $\displaystyle \oint \vv B \cdot \vv{ds} = \mu_0I_{enc}$, what is the magnetic field at the point shown in the figure above?  
\vspace{0.4in}

%\pagebreak
(d) Ampere's law, as we've written it so far, seems to imply that the magnetic field above the wire can change discontinuously to zero if you move by even one \textit{nanometer} to the right, depending on whether your loop is just to the left or just to the right of the capacitor plate.  Does it seem plausible to you that the magnetic field would change discontinuously like that?
\vspace{0.5in}

(e)  There's another, more sophisticated argument against the magnetic field going to zero that's based on a mathematical idea known as Stoke's Theorem.  When we say ``current enclosed by a loop,'' what we really mean is ``current piercing through a surface bound by a loop.'' But there's nothing that says that the surface has to be flat.  In the drawing on the left, the gray surface is a flat disk.  On the right, the surface is stretched into a hollow hemisphere around the capacitor plate.  Do the two surfaces both have the same current piercing through them?
\begin{center}

\vspace{-0.1in}
\end{center}

So according to $\displaystyle \oint \vv B \cdot \vv{ds} = \mu_0I_{enc}$, the magnetic field $\vv B$ at a point near a wire can change from zero to nonzero by either moving the point to the left or right by an infinitesimally small amount, or worse, by just imagining a different shape surface in your head!  Maxwell knew that couldn't be right: \textit{Ampere's law was broken!}

(f) Maxwell knew about Faraday's law of induction, ${\cal E}=-d \Phi_B/dt$, where the emf ${\cal E}$ is a voltage, given by $\displaystyle \oint \vv{E} \cdot \vv{ds}$.  In words, what does Faraday's law mean?
\begin{center}
Faraday sez: ``A changing \underline{\hspace{1in}} field induces a(n) \underline{\hspace{1in}} field.''
\end{center}
(g) When the switch is closed in the picture below on the left, in the brief time that current starts to flow, the magnetic field between the solenoids increases, which according to Faraday's law induces an electric field nearby, including along the dotted line.  Maxwell wondered if the reverse of Faraday's law was also true: could a changing electric field also induce a magnetic field?  In the picture below on the right, draw lines showing the electric field $\vv{E}$ as the capacitor charges up.

    \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{deriving_em_waves/capacitor_and_loop.pdf}
\vspace{-0.1in}
\end{center}

(h) As current flows in the picture on the right, is the electric field between the plates increasing, decreasing, or staying the same?

\textbf{Activity 2: Help Maxwell Fix Up Amp\`ere's Law!}

Maxwell decided to add a term involving $d\Phi_E/dt$ to Amp\`ere's law, to account for magnetic field due to the change in electric field.

\end{center}

In this activity, you'll help Maxwell find the right value for the constant, so that $\displaystyle \oint \vv B \cdot \vv{ds}$ is the same around either of the dashed loops in the picture above.  This means finding the right value of the constant so that
\begin{displaymath}
\mu_0I = [CONSTANT] \frac{d\Phi_E}{dt}.
\end{displaymath}

\vspace{-0.1in}
(a) Rewrite the equation just above, writing the electric flux $\Phi_E$ in terms of the electric field $E$ and the area $A$.
\vspace{0.4in}

(b) What is the area $A$ you just used: the circular area of the loop, or the area of the capacitor plate?
\vspace{0.3in}

(c) If the plates have charge $+Q$ and $-Q$ on them, what is the electric field $E$ between the plates, in terms of $Q$ and $A$?\label{part_ampere_field_between_plates}
\vspace{0.6in}

(d) Rewrite your equation from part (a), in terms of $Q$ and $A$ instead of $E$.
\vspace{0.5in}

(e) What is the general relationship between current $I$ and charge $Q$? (Hint: Perhaps something with a time derivative?)
\vspace{0.3in}

(f) Rewrite your equation from (d) in terms of $I$.
\vspace{0.5in}

(g) At this point it should be clear what that constant should be.  Rewrite the new, fixed-up version of Amp\`ere's law using the constant you've found.  Maxwell thanks you!

\textbf{Activity 3: How do changing fields affect each other?} 

Maxwell must have been pretty excited to figure this out!  He already knew that a changing $\vv B$ could cause a $\vv E$, and now he knew that a changing $\vv E$ could cause a $\vv B$.  What if the two could keep causing each other?  Maybe a changing $\vv E$ could cause a $\vv B$, and then that could cause another $\vv E$, and so on, forever?  What would that look like? To find out, we'll look at the case of $\vv E$ and $\vv B$ shown in the figure below.

%Our goal now is to take the two equations we already have, Faraday's law and the newly fixed-up Amp\`ere's law, and see what kind of behavior they lead to in $\vec E$ and $\vec B$.  We'll do this by looking at a case where $\vec B$ is in the $z$ direction,and the electric field is along the $y$ axis, as shown in the figure below.  

\vspace{-0.1in}

\includegraphics[width=0.89\textwidth]{deriving_em_waves/change_in_E.pdf}
\newpage

In equations (1) and (2) we now have equations that link time and spatial derivatives of $\vv E$ and $\vv B$ together.  Now, we'll do just a little more math to separate \textit{just} $\vv E$ in one equation, and \textit{just} $\vv B$ in another.  Again, we'll show you how to do it for one of them, then you'll do the other one.

\textbf{Activity 4: What it all means}

You've seen equations like these before when you studied waves.  You know that in general, the equation for a one dimensional wave (like a wave on a string, for instance) is
\begin{displaymath}
\frac{\partial^2y(x,t)}{\partial x^2}= \frac{1}{v^2} \frac{\partial^2y(x,t)}{\partial t^2},
\end{displaymath}
where $v$ is the speed of the wave.  Maxwell knew this too, of course, and he was eager to find out how fast this new kind of wave traveled.

(a) Comparing the equations for $E$ and $B$ that you just derived with the wave equation above, what is the speed of the waves $\vv E(x,t)$ and $\vv B(x,t)$, in terms of $\mu_0$ and $\epsilon_0$?
\vspace{0.5in}

(b)  The accepted values for $\mu_0$ and $\epsilon_0$ are $\mu_0=4\pi \times 10^{-7}$ N$\cdot$s$^2$/C$^2$ and 
$\epsilon_0=8.85 \times 10^{-12}$ C$^2$/N$\cdot $m$^2$.  Calculate a numerical value for the speed of the waves 
$\vv E(x,t)$ and $\vv B(x,t)$.
\vspace{0.5in}

(c) What else do you know that goes that fast?
\vspace{0.5in}

Maxwell knew that too!  And at the time, light was generally understood to be some kind of wave (due to interference and diffraction effects, for instance), but nobody could imagine what kind of wave it was, or what kind of thing was actually \textit{doing} the waving.  As Maxwell proclaimed, ``We can scarcely avoid the conclusion that light consists in the transverse undulations of the same medium which is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.''  Very quickly after that, Maxwell and other physicists were able to explain virtually every known property of optics in terms of electromagnetic phenomena.  In just over forty years, starting with  Hans Christian \O rsted's discovery in 1819 that electric current could deflect a compass needle, physics had now completely unified the fields of magnetism, electricity, and optics into a single theory.
