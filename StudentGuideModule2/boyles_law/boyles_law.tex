\textbf{Introduction}

The behavior of a gas can be described in terms of the macroscopic quantities:
temperature ($T$), pressure ($P$), and volume ($V$). The relationship between these
quantities is given by the equation of state of the gas. A real gas behaves
approximately as an ideal gas if it is far from liquefaction. In that case,
the equation of state of an ideal gas can be used to describe a real gas. For
a given mass of a gas, if one of the quantities $P$, $T$, or $V$ is changed, a change
in the other two quantities probably will result. However, if one of the quantities
is kept constant, the relationship between the other two can be studied. The
relationship between pressure and volume of an ideal gas is called Boyle's law.

The experimental apparatus is shown in the figure above. The gas is air contained
in a syringe that has marking on its side to measure the volume of the syringe.
A short tube connects the syringe with a pressure sensor that measures the pressure
in the tube and converts that measurement into a signal that can be read by
the DataStudio interface.

\textbf{Activity 1: Relationship Between \textit{P} and \textit{V} of a Gas}

(a) Check that there are no leaks in the apparatus by trying to compress
the syringe from the 20.0~ml position to the 10.0~ml position. It should become
increasingly difficult to push the plunger as the volume decreases. If this
is not the case, check the couplings for fit. If no problem is obvious, then
consult your instructor.

(b) The initial volume of air in the syringe should be set at 20.0~ml. If your
syringe is set to some other value, disconnect the quick release connector from
the sensor by gently rotating it in the counter-clockwise direction as you look
from the syringe toward the pressure sensor. Next, move the piston to the
20.0~ml position, and then re-connect the quick release connector to the pressure
sensor. 

(c) \textbf{Data Recording}. Open the file \filename{Boyles\_Law.cap} located in the 
\filename{\coursefolder} folder.  The data you take will be recorded in the table on the left, and plotted in the graph on the right.  To begin recording data, make sure the piston is at the 20-ml setting, and click
the \button{Preview} button, which is where the \button{Record} button usually would be. 
Once you hit \button{Preview}, the current value of the pressure will appear in the table.  
When you hit the \button{Keep Sample} button, the pressure reading at that time will be saved, and the current pressure will continue to be displayed in the next row.  For each pressure you record, you will need to click in the right hand column and type in the syringe volume (in ml) by hand.  (Values from 20~ml down to 10~ml by 1-ml increments will be fine.)

NOTE: For the first pressure reading at 20~ml, the air in the syringe will be
in thermal equilibrium with the environment. This will \textit{not} be the case immediately
after compressing the syringe for the next reading. Therefore, you must allow
a couple of seconds for the system to return to thermal equilibrium after you 
compress the syringe and \textit{before} clicking on \button{Keep Sample} to record pressure values. 

(d) Compress the syringe to the next value of the volume 
and wait a couple of seconds for the system to reach thermal equilibrium. Once 
thermal equilibrium is reached, click \button{Keep Sample} to record the pressure, and enter the volume into the table.

(e) Repeat step (d) for the remaining values of the volume down to 10~ml.  After you record
the pressure for the last volume (10~ml), click the \button{Stop} button to end data recording.

(f) \textbf{Analysis.} What happened to the pressure when the volume was 
reduced from 20~ml to 10~ml? From looking at the data, do the pressure and 
volume seem to be directly or inversely proportional? Explain.

(g) Copy your data into a spreadsheet and plot pressure versus volume 
(including a title and axis labels with units). Next, fit your data with a 
trendline using a power function. Record the result here. What is the power of 
$V$? Print the graph and include it with this unit.
%What should you get for the power? Why?
\vspace{25mm}

(h) If pressure and volume are inversely proportional, then what can you say
about the product of pressure and volume? Explain.

(i) The measurements you have made are $V$ in milliliters (ml) and $P$ in 
kilopascals (kPa). What are the corresponding units of $PV$? Show how you get 
this here (the result must be in energy units):
\vspace{40mm}

(j) Construct a table in the space below with the column headings: $V$ (ml), $P$
(kPa), and $PV$. Include the units from above in the last column.
Enter the results for $P$ and $V$ in this new table and calculate
$PV$ for each set of readings. Determine the mean value and the standard deviation
$\sigma$ for $PV$. Record the results in the form 
$PV =$ Mean $\pm \, \sigma$. Be sure to include the proper units. 
What does this result tell you about the  product $PV$?

\vspace{12cm}

(k) Is there a trend in the values of $PV$ as the volume decreases? If so, 
what do you suppose causes that trend?

%(j) Examine the plot on the next page with results from two different data 
%runs. How do you explain the difference between the curves for the different 
%tubing lengths (\( \triangle L \) in the diagram on the next page)?
